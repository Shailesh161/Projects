# üöÄ Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

This Python program allows users to visualize the process of finding the shortest path between two points on a grid using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It provides an interactive GUI where users can set the start point, end point, and obstacles on the grid and then observe the algorithm in action.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Users can click on the grid to place the start point, end point, and obstacles.
- **BFS Algorithm Visualization**: The program visualizes the BFS algorithm in action to find the shortest path between the start and end points.
- **Random Obstacle Placement**: Users can press a key to randomly place obstacles on the grid.
- **Clear Grid**: Users can clear the grid at any time to start over.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (`turtle`)
- NumPy library (`numpy`)
- Tkinter library (`tkinter`) for message box

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script `pathfinding_visualizer.py`.
2. **Set Start and End Points**:
   - Press the 's' key and click anywhere on the grid to set the start point (displayed in green).
   - Press the 'e' key and click anywhere on the grid to set the end point (displayed in blue).
3. **Place Obstacles**:
   - Press the 'h' key and click anywhere on the grid to place obstacles (displayed in red).
4. **Visualize Shortest Path**:
   - Press the space bar to initiate the BFS algorithm and visualize the shortest path between the start and end points.
5. **Clear the Grid**:
   - Press the 'o' key to clear the grid and start over.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Instructions

- **Set Start and End Points**: Use the 's' and 'e' keys to set the start and end points respectively.
- **Place Obstacles**: Use the 'h' key to place obstacles on the grid.
- **Random Obstacle Placement**: Press the 'r' key to place random obstacles on the grid.
- **Visualize Shortest Path**: Press the space bar to visualize the shortest path between the start and end points.
- **Clear the Grid**: Press the 'o' key to clear the grid and start over.

## üìù Note

- If no path is found between the start and end points, a message box will appear indicating that no path was found.
